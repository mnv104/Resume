	-  As part of an ongoing research effort, I am 
	investigating performance trade-offs due to 
	aggressive file system caching and consistency
	semantics dictated by application needs and looking
	at meaningful ways of expressing consistency 
	requirements that can be exploited by the underlying
	parallel file system (CAPFS, PVFS2). 
	-  Explored techniques to enhance the performance 
	and isolate potential bottlenecks in the POSIX I/O 
	interface implementation of a parallel file system 
	(PVFS). 


Research Assistant in Computer Systems Lab 					May 2001 - Present 
CSE Dept, Penn State, University Park, PA 16802				May 2000 - Aug 2000 

	-  As part of my thesis research, I investigated 
	run-time system support for effective buffer management 
	of large-scale scientific applications. More specifically,
	I looked at efficient caching and replacement 
	algorithms for explicitly I/O intensive and scaled versions 
	of in-core applications.

	  using the Pthreads library and sockets API on Solaris as part of a graduate 
	  level course on Operating Systems(C).

   + Developed an execution-driven simulator that simulates a cc-NUMA machine's
	  (SGI-Origin) memory system that can be used to investigate the performance 
	  of parallel applications as part of a graduate level course on Multiprocessor 
	  architectures(C).

   + Designed and implemented new algorithms for demonstrating Steganography, 
	  i.e. hiding text in images (as a group project) as part of an under-graduate
