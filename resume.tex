     \item {First employee of a storage startup that pioneered the notion of a
           distributed scale out storage tier to complement a capacity tier of
           storage. Helped architect and implement
           large portions of the FVP software stack to accelerate virtual
           machine I/O performance using RAM and direct-attached flash
        resources on hypervisor. Contributed heavily to the company's IP
     portfolio and filed several patents and a paper at a reputed storage
  conference.}

               several key features and scalability enhancements for VMFS over the
               course of 4 major releases of ESX.}

               projects (Distributed Deduplication for VMFS, Distributed data
               movement in a cluster, Hybrid-locking and network-based locking techniques to scale VMFS
               meta-data performance, Distributed quotas and reservations for a
